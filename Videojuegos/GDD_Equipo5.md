### **Summary**

The primary concept of the game is to incentivize the players to learn about percussive instruments and their importance in music. Some of the ideas presented in the game are: identifying the different percussion instruments, notes, rhythms, and health practices. 

By traveling through the islands and completing mini-games, the player will unlock various percussive instruments that open new paths to explore.

The genre of the game is a pokemon-style RPG, divided into islands that represent sections to learn (health, note and sound recognition, instruments...) they will not be demanding in terms of the use of keys and agile movements with the mouse, addition to be friendly, interactive and intuitive for anyone who wants to learn about percussion.

### **Gameplay**
The gameplay is going to be divided into diferent kinds. The main one is going to be a Pokémon-like RPG exploration inside a tiled map, where the player explores diferent islands and interacts with NPC's and instruments. 

Then, each island is going to have different kinds of minigames, such a trivia relating to information regarding percussion. Another one would be a rhythm game where the player has to play the right notes at the right time, and is scored depending on the precision, like Taiko no Tatsujin. 

If time allows it, we would to a sound recognition game, where the player would first learn about the sounds of different instruments, and then is asked to recognize the instruments in different clips.

### **Minigames**

- Trivia
- Memory Games (Identify sounds and notes)
- Rhythm

### **Mindset**

(Mor info Salvador)

When the player is navigating the map, we want to provoke a calming feeling, because of the island theme. We also want to make the player curious so they explore all the game has to offer.

During the minigames, we want to pressure the player a little bit, because that's where they get tested on their knowledge.

### **Screens**

1. Title Screen
    1. Options
2. Game
    1. Inventory
    2. Trivia Game
    3. Rhythm game
    4. Memory Game 
    4. Main screen (map navigation)
3. End Credits


### **Controls**

Movement is determined by 'W','A','S','D'. You can interact with NPC's by pressing the 'I' key. Also you can enter buildings by running into the doors.

The pause menu is opened with the escape key, it's navigated with 'W','A','S','D', things are selected with 'I' and you go back with 'O'. The trivia and memory games are played with those same controls.

*Especificar cada minigame (Salvador)

_(Controls for the rhythm game are TBD) The idea is to use the A and D keys to hit the notes_

### **Mechanics**

- General mechanics:
    - The player can to move in the four cardinal points. 
    - When the player gets near a building it can enter the building.
    - Also when the player is near an NPC you can talk to it.
    - If an obstacle blocks the way but the challenge has not been solved, you cannot proceed to the next island.
    - You can interact with obstacles so they can move out the way.
    - If there are no obstacles on the bridges, the player can move to other islands.
    - Can be interacted with randomly placed instruments within the island. 
    - Instruments found on the island can be stored in the inventory.
    - You can select instruments from the inventory to see their information or listen to their sound.
    - There are non-interactive objects that block the way (structures, end of the island, trees, rocks...).

Mechanics of mini-games: 
- In case of losing the game, in all mini-games the player has the option to retry or return to the island map.
1. Memory notes / sounds 
    - Click on the instruments/notes (as appropiate) to generate the sound corresponding to the element.
    - If the elements are selected in the correct order, generate a melody with the selected sounds.
    - The intensity and speed at which the sounds are displayed increase upon successful completion of a sequence.
2. Trivia 
    - If necessary, the player can scroll the screen to see all the questions.
    - The answers are multiple choice, the player must select one of the answer boxes corresponding to the question.
    - At the end you will find a box to send the answers. 
3. Rhythm 
    - According to the letters selected on the keyboard, the player must press the corresponding key at the moment. 
    - As the correct hits are made, the sounds generated by the note are heard.
    - if the player does not make a hit or presses the wrong key no sound is generated (sound muffled).



Are there any interesting mechanics? If so, how are you going to accomplish them? Physics, algorithms, etc.

### **Style Attributes**

For this game, we are using as primarly inspiration the classic Pokemon RPG games, which most of the time use vibrant and joyful colors. To truly make the esthetic of the game as consistent as possible, we are going to define specific colors on our sprites that must match in every section of the game.

![](gametiles.jpeg)

Graphic-wise, we decided to create a 2D RPG pixel game. Not only this style will allow us to improve on other aspects of the game (minigames, soundtrack) but also provoke a relaxing gaming experience. 

Most of the learning of percussion instruments will be in the various minigames. With that said, this section must be well developed to incentivize the players to keep learning and playing.

## _Sounds/Music_

--- 

### **Style Attributes**

The main objective of our game is to teach the players about the different types of percussion instruments and their importance in music. With this in mind, it is vital to include music that utilizes this type of instrument. The rhythm minigame will have various songs, in which percussion instruments are in the main spotlight. 

For the background music played while the player explores the map, we are going to use songs that resemble the relaxing atmosphere of the famous game Animal Crossing.

### **Sounds Needed**

1. Effects
    1. Chest Opening
    2. Door Opening
    3. Menu navigation (move and confirm)
    4. Dialogue interaction (confirmation sounds) 
    5. Instrument samples (snare, xylophone, marimba, etc.)
    6. Birds getting scared
    7. Ambient water and air
2. Feedback
    1. Happy chime (item get)
    2. Progression success (ex. scaring birds)

Possible Musical notes:
1. playable instrumets:
    - Xilophone
    - Marimba
    - Bongo
    - Snare 
2. Non-playable instruments:
    - Triangle
